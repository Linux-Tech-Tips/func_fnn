# Function Approximator Perceptron

This project is a Multi-Layer Perceptron FNN model, coded in C, entirely from scratch, using only the C standard library.

The example use case the MLP is showcased on is to serve as a universal function approximator, as that's what the MLP model is, in principle.

To help visualise this, here, the MLP takes 2 variable inputs and produces one output, thus serving as an approximator for functions from R^2 to R^1.

In the program, this is represented using something akin to a heatmap (using ASCII text output).

Try `make run` followed by `./func.elf help` to compile the project and see what commands are available.

More features might be coming in the future, for now, I should probably study for exams.
